Genesis,19,12," Then the [two] men H582 said H559 to H413 Lot , H3876 “ Do H4310 you have anyone  else H5750 here — H6311 a son-in-law , H2860 your sons H1121 or daughters , H1323 or anyone H3605 else in the city H5892 who belongs H834 to you ?  Get them out H3318 of H4480 here , H4725"
Genesis,19,13, because H3588 we H587 - H853 are about to destroy H7843 this H2088 place . H4725 For H3588 the outcry H6818 to H854 . . . H6440 the LORD H3068 [against its people] is so great H1431 that [He] H3068 has sent us H7971 to destroy it . ” H7843
Genesis,19,14," So Lot H3876 went out H3318 and spoke H1696 to H413 the sons-in-law H2860 who were pledged in marriage to H3947 his daughters . H1323 “ Get up , ” H6965 he said . H559 “ Get out H3318 of H4480 this H2088 place , H4725 for H3588 the LORD H3068 - H853 is about to destroy H7843 the city ! ” H5892 But his sons-in-law H2860 thought H5869 he was H1961 joking . H6711"
Genesis,19,15," At H3644 daybreak H7837 . . . H5927 the angels H4397 hurried H213 Lot along , H3876 saying , H559 “ Get up ! H6965 Take H3947 - H853 your wife H802 - H853 and your two H8147 daughters H1323 who are here , H4672 or H6435 you will be swept away H5595 in the punishment H5771 of the city . ” H5892"
Genesis,19,16," But when [Lot] hesitated , H4102 the men H582 grabbed H2388 his hand H3027 and the hands H3027 of his wife H802 and H3027 his two H8147 daughters . H1323 And they led them H3318 safely H5117 out of H2351 the city , H5892 because of the LORD’s H3068 compassion H2551 for them . H5921"
Genesis,19,17," - H1961 As soon as the men had brought H3318 them H853 out , H2351 one of them said , H559 “ Run H4422 for H5921 your lives ! H5315 Do not H408 look H5027 back , H310 and do not H408 stop H5975 anywhere H3605 on the plain ! H3603 Flee H4422 to the mountains , H2022 or H6435 you will be swept away ! ” H5595"
Genesis,19,18," But Lot H3876 replied H559 . . . , H413 “ No , H408 my lords , H136 please ! H4994"
Genesis,19,19," Your servant H5650 has indeed H2009 . . . H4994 found H4672 favor H2580 in your sight , H5869 and you have shown me H6213 . . . H5978 great H1431 kindness H2617 - H834 by sparing H2421 - H853 my life . H5315 But I H595 cannot H3808 . . . H3201 run H4422 to the mountains ; H2022 . . . H6435 the disaster H7451 will overtake me , H1692 and I will die . H4191"
Genesis,19,20," Look , H2009 there [is] H2063 a town H5892 nearby H7138 where H8033 I can flee , H5127 and it H1931 is a small place . H4705 Please H4994 let me flee H4422 . . . H4994 there — H8033 is it H1931 not H3808 a small place ? H4705 Then my life H5315 will be saved . ” H2421"
Genesis,19,21," “ Very well , ” H2009 he answered H559 . . . , H413 “ I will grant this request H5375 . . . H6440 . . . H2088 . . . H1697 as well , H1571 and will not H1115 demolish H2015 - H853 the town H5892 - H834 you indicate . H1696"
Genesis,19,22," Hurry ! H4116 Run H4422 there quickly , H8033 for H3588 I cannot H3808 . . . H3201 do H6213 anything H1697 until H5704 you reach H935 it . ” H8033 That is why H5921 . . . H3651 the town H5892 was called H7121 . . . H8034 Zoar . H6820"
Genesis,19,23," And by the time the sun H8121 had risen H3318 over H5921 the land , H776 Lot H3876 had reached H935 Zoar . H6820"
Genesis,19,24, Then the LORD H3068 rained down H4305 sulfur H1614 and fire H784 on H5921 Sodom H5467 . . . H5921 and Gomorrah — H6017 from H854 the LORD H3068 out of H4480 the heavens . H8064
Genesis,19,25," Thus He destroyed H2015 - H853 these H411 - H853 cities H5892 and the entire H3605 plain , H3603 including H853 all H3605 the inhabitants H3427 of the cities H5892 and everything that grew H6780 on the ground . H127"
Genesis,19,26," But [Lot’s] wife H802 looked H5027 back , H310 and she became H1961 a pillar H5333 of salt . H4417"
Genesis,19,27," Early the next morning , H1242 Abraham H85 got up H7925 and returned to H413 the place H4725 where H834 he had stood H5975 . . . H8033 . . . H854 before H6440 the LORD . H3068"
Genesis,19,28," He looked H8259 down H5921 toward H6440 Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017 . . . H5921 and all H3605 . . . H6440 the land H776 of the plain , H3603 and he saw H7200 . . . H2009 the smoke H7008 rising H5927 from the land H776 like smoke H7008 from a furnace . H3536"
Genesis,19,29," So H1961 when God H430 - H853 destroyed H7843 the cities H5892 of the plain , H3603 He H430 - H853 remembered H2142 Abraham , H85 and He brought H7971 - H853 Lot H3876 out of the H8432 catastrophe H2018 that destroyed H2015 - H853 the cities H5892 where H834 [he] H3876 had lived H3427 . . . . "
Genesis,19,30, Lot H3876 and H5973 his two H8147 daughters H1323 left H5927 Zoar H6820 and settled H3427 in the mountains — H2022 for H3588 he was afraid H3372 to stay H3427 in Zoar — H6820 where [they] H1931 . . . H8147 . . . H1323 lived H3427 in a cave . H4631
Genesis,19,31," One day the older [daughter] H1067 said H559 to H413 the younger , H6810 “ Our father H1 is old , H2204 and there is no H369 man H376 in the land H776 to sleep with H935 us , H5921 as is the custom H1870 over all H3605 the earth . H776"
Genesis,19,32," Come , H1980 let us get our father H1 drunk H8248 - H853 with wine H3196 so we can sleep H7901 with him H5973 and preserve H2421 [his] H1 line . ” H2233"
Genesis,19,33," So that H1931 night H3915 they got their father H1 drunk H8248 - H853 with wine , H3196 and the firstborn H1067 went in H935 and slept with H7901 - H853 her father ; H1 he was not H3808 aware H3045 when she lay down H7901 or when she got up . H6965"

Genesis,19,36, Thus both H8147 of Lot’s H3876 daughters H1323 became pregnant H2029 by their father . H1
Genesis,19,37, The older [daughter] H1067 gave birth to H3205 a son H1121 and named him H7121 . . . H8034 Moab . H4124 He H1931 is the father H1 of the Moabites H4124 of H5704 today . H3117

Genesis,20,1," Now Abraham H85 journeyed H5265 from there H8033 to the region H776 of the Negev H5045 and settled H3427 between H996 Kadesh H6946 . . . H996 and Shur . H7793 While he was staying H1481 in Gerar , H1642"
Genesis,20,2," Abraham H85 said H559 of H413 his wife H802 Sarah , H8283 “ She H1931 is my sister . ” H269 So Abimelech H40 king H4428 of Gerar H1642 had Sarah H8283 brought H7971 to him . H3947 - H853"
Genesis,20,3," One night, however , H3915 God H430 came H935 to H413 Abimelech H40 in a dream H2472 and told H559 him ,  - H2009 “ You are as good as dead H4191 because of H5921 the woman H802 - H834 you have taken , H3947 for she H1931 is a married H1166 woman. ” H1167"
Genesis,20,4," Now Abimelech H40 had not H3808 gone H7126 near her , H413 so he replied , H559 “ Lord , H136 would You destroy H2026 a nation H1471 even though H1571 it is innocent ? H6662"
Genesis,20,5," Didn’t H3808 [Abraham] H1931 tell H559 me ,  ‘ She H1931 is my sister ’? H269 And she H1931 . . . H1571 herself H1931 said , H559 ‘ He H1931 is my brother . ’ H251 I have done H6213 this H2063 in the integrity H8537 of my heart H3824 and the innocence H5356 of my hands . ” H3709"
Genesis,20,6," Then God H430 said H559 to [Abimelech] H413 in the dream , H2472 “ Yes , H1571 I H595 know H3045 that H3588 you did H6213 this H2063 with a clear H8537 conscience , H3824 and so I H595 . . . H1571 have kept H2820 you H853 from sinning H2398 against Me .  That is why H5921 . . . H3651 I did not H3808 let H5414 you touch H5060 her . H413"
Genesis,20,7," Now H6258 return H7725 the man’s H376 wife , H802 for H3588 he H1931 is a prophet ; H5030 he will pray H6419 for you H1157 and you will live . H2421 But if H518 you do not H369 restore her , H7725 be aware H3045 that H3588 you will surely H4191 die — H4191 you H859 and all H3605 who belong H834 to you . ” "
Genesis,20,8," Early the next morning H1242 Abimelech H40 got up H7925 and summoned H7121 all H3605 his servants ; H5650 and when he described to them H1696 - H853 - H241 all H3605 that H428 had happened , H1697 the men H582 were terrified H3372 . . . . H3966"
Genesis,20,9," Then Abimelech H40 called H7121 Abraham H85 and asked H559 ,  “ What H4100 have you done H6213 to us ?

Genesis,20,10," Abimelech H40 also asked H559 . . . H413 Abraham , H85 “ What H4100 prompted H7200 . . . H3588 you to do H6213 - H853 such H2088 a thing ? ” H1697"

Genesis,20,13," - H1961 So when H834 God H430 had me journey H8582 - H853 from my father’s H1 house , H1004 I said H559 to [Sarah] ,  ‘ This is how H2088 - H834 you can show H6213 your loyalty H2617 to me : H5978 . . .

Genesis,20,14," So Abimelech H40 brought H3947 sheep H6629 and cattle , H1241 menservants H5650 and maidservants , H8198 and he gave them H5414 to Abraham H85 and restored H7725 - H853 his wife H802 Sarah H8283 to him . "
Genesis,20,15," And Abimelech H40 said , H559 “ Look , H2009 my land H776 is before you . H6440 Settle wherever you please H3427 . . . H2896 . . . . ” H5869"

H5869 before all H3605 who H834 are with you H854 . . . ; H854 you are completely H3605 cleared . ” H3198"
Genesis,20,17," Then Abraham H85 prayed H6419 to H413 God , H430 and God H430 - H853 healed H7495 Abimelech H40 - H853 and his wife H802 and his maidservants , H519 so that they could again bear children — H3205"
Genesis,20,18," for H3588 on H5921 account H1697 of Abraham’s H85 wife H802 Sarah , H8283 the LORD H3068 . . . H1157 had completely closed H6113 . . . H6113 all H3605 the wombs H7358 in Abimelech’s H40 household . H1004"
Genesis,21,1," Now the LORD H3068 attended H6485 - H853 to Sarah H8283 as H834 He had said , H559 and the LORD H3068 did H6213 for Sarah H8283 what H834 He had promised . H1696"
Genesis,21,2," So Sarah H8283 conceived H2029 and bore H3205 a son H1121 to Abraham H85 in his old age , H2208 at the very time H4150 - H834 God H430 had promised H1696 . . . . H854"

Genesis,21,7," She added , H559 “ Who H4310 would have told H4448 Abraham H85 that Sarah H8283 would nurse H3243 children ? H1121 Yet H3588 I have borne him H3205 a son H1121 in his old age . ” H2208"
Genesis,21,8," So the child H3206 grew H1431 and was weaned , H1580 and Abraham H85 held H6213 a great H1419 feast H4960 on the day H3117 Isaac H3327 was weaned . H1580 - H853"

Genesis,21,17," Then God H430 - H853 heard H8085 the voice H6963 of the boy , H5288 and the angel H4397 of God H430 called H7121 to H413 Hagar H1904 from H4480 heaven H8064 - H559 ,  “ What is wrong H4100 ,  Hagar ?

Genesis,25,34," Then Jacob H3290 gave H5414 some bread H3899 and lentil H5742 stew H5138 to Esau , H6215 [who] ate H398 and drank H8354 and then got up H6965 and went away . H1980 Thus Esau H6215 - H853 despised H959 his birthright . H1062"
Genesis,26,1," Now there was H1961 another famine H7458 in the land , H776 subsequent to H905 the [one] H7458 . . . H7223 that H834 had occurred H1961 in Abraham’s H85 time . H3117 And Isaac H3327 went H1980 to H413 Abimelech H40 king H4428 of the Philistines H6430 at Gerar . H1642"

Genesis,26,9," Abimelech H40 sent for H7121 Isaac H3327 and said , H559 “ So she H1931 is really H389 . . . H2009 your wife ! H802 How H349 could you say , H559 ‘ She H1931 is my sister ’? ” H269 Isaac H3327 replied , H559 . . . H413 “ Because H3588 I thought H559 I might H6435 die H4191 on account of her . ” H5921"
Genesis,26,10," “ What H4100 is this H2063 you have done H6213 to us ? ”  asked H559 Abimelech . H40 “ One H259 of the people H5971 - H853 could easily H4592 have slept with H7901 your wife , H802 and you would have brought H935 guilt H817 upon us . ” H5921"

Genesis,26,14, He owned so many H1961 flocks H4735 . . . H6629 and herds H4735 . . . H1241 and H7227 servants H5657 that the Philistines H6430 envied him . H7065 - H853
Genesis,26,15, So the Philistines H6430 took H4390 dirt H6083 and stopped up H5640 all H3605 the wells H875 that H834 his father’s H1 servants H5650 had dug H2658 in the days H3117 of his father H1 Abraham . H85

Genesis,26,17, So Isaac H3327 left H1980 that place H8033 and encamped H2583 in the Valley H5158 of Gerar H1642 and settled H3427 there . H8033

Genesis,26,21, Then they dug H2658 another H312 well H875 and quarreled H7378 over H5921 that one {also} ; H1571 so he named H7121 it H8034 Sitnah . H7856
Genesis,26,22," He moved on H6275 from there H8033 and dug H2658 . . . H875 another [well] , H312 and they did not H3808 quarrel H7378 over it .

H7704 When he brought H935 them H853 to H413 his mother H517 - , H3812 Rachel H7354 begged H559 . . . H413 Leah , H3812 “ Please H4994 give me H5414 some of  your son’s H1121 mandrakes . ” H1736"
Genesis,30,15," But Leah replied H559 ,  “ Is it not enough H4592 that you have taken away H3947 - H853 my husband ? H376 Now you H1571 - H853 want to take H3947 my son’s H1121 mandrakes [as well] ? ” H1736 “ Very well , ” H3651 said H559 Rachel , H7354 “ he may sleep H7901 with you H5973 tonight H3915 in exchange for H8478 your son’s H1121 mandrakes . ” H1736"
Genesis,30,16," When Jacob H3290 came in H935 from H4480 the field H7704 that evening , H6153 Leah H3812 went out H3318 to meet him H7122 and said , H559 “ You must come H935 with me , H413 for H3588 I have hired you H7936 . . . H7936 with my son’s H1121 mandrakes . ” H1736 So [he] slept H7901 with her H5973 that H1931 night . H3915"
Genesis,30,17," And God H430 listened H8085 to H413 Leah , H3812 and she conceived H2029 and bore H3205 a fifth H2549 son H1121 to Jacob . H3290"
Genesis,30,18," Then Leah H3812 said , H559 “ God H430 has rewarded me H5414 . . . H7939 for H834 giving H5414 my maidservant H8198 to my husband . ” H376 So she named him H7121 . . . H8034 Issachar . H3485"
Genesis,30,19, Again H5750 Leah H3812 conceived H2029 and bore H3205 a sixth H8345 son H1121 to Jacob . H3290
Genesis,30,20," “ God H430 - H853 has given me H2064 a good H2896 gift , ” H2065 [she] H3812 said . H559 “ This time H6471 my husband H376 will honor me , H2082 because H3588 I have borne H3205 him  six H8337 sons . ” H1121 And she named H7121 - H853 him H8034 Zebulun . H2074"
Genesis,30,21," After that , H310 Leah gave birth to H3205 a daughter H1323 and named H7121 - H853 her H8034 Dinah . H1783"
Genesis,30,22," Then God H430 - H853 remembered H2142 Rachel . H7354 He H430 listened H8085 to her H413 and opened H6605 - H853 her womb , H7358"
Genesis,30,23," and she conceived H2029 and gave birth to H3205 a son . H1121 “ God H430 - H853 has taken away H622 my shame , ” H2781 she said . H559"
Genesis,30,24," She named H7121 - H853 him H8034 Joseph , H3130 and said , H559 “ May the LORD H3068 add H3254 to me  another H312 son . ” H1121"
Genesis,30,25," Now H1961 after H834 Rachel H7354 - H853 had given birth to H3205 Joseph , H3130 Jacob H3290 said H559 to H413 Laban , H3837 “ Send me on my way H7971 so I can return H1980 to H413 my homeland H4725 . . . . H776"
Genesis,30,26," Give H5414 [me] H853 my wives H802 and H853 children H3206 for whom H834 I have served you , H5647 - H853 -  that I may go on my way . H1980 . . . H3588 You H859 know H3045 - H853 how H834 hard I have worked H5656 for you . ” H5647"
Genesis,30,27," But Laban H3837 replied H559 . . . , H413 “ If H518 I have found H4672 favor H2580 in your eyes , H5869 please stay . H4994 I have learned by divination H5172 that the LORD H3068 has blessed me H1288 because of you . ” H1558"
Genesis,30,28," And he added , H559 “ Name H5344 your wages , H7939 . . . H5921 and I will pay them . ” H5414"
Genesis,30,29," Then [Jacob] answered H559 . . . , H413 “ You H859 know H3045 - H853 how H834 I have served you H5647 and H853 how H834 your livestock H4735 have thrived H1961 under my care . H854"
Genesis,30,30," Indeed , H3588 you had H1961 . . .  very little H4592 - H834 before my arrival , H6440 but now your wealth H7230 has increased many times over . H6555 The LORD H3068 has blessed H1288 you H853 wherever I set foot . H7272 But now , H6258 when H4970 may I H595 also H1571 provide H6213 for my own household ? ” H1004"
Genesis,30,31," “ What H4100 can I give H5414 you ? ”  Laban asked . H559 “ You do not H3808 need to give H5414 me  anything , ” H3972 Jacob replied H3290 . . . . H559 “ If H518 you do H6213 this H2088 one thing H1697 for me ,  I will keep on H7725 shepherding H7462 and keeping H8104 your flocks . H6629"
Genesis,30,32," Let me go H5674 through all H3605 your flocks H6629 today H3117 and remove H5493 from them H8033 every H3605 speckled H5348 or spotted H2921 sheep , H7716 every H3605 dark-colored H2345 vvv H7716 lamb , H3775 and every spotted H2921 or speckled H5348 goat . H5795 These will be H1961 my wages . H7939"
Genesis,30,33," So my honesty H6666 will testify H6030 for me  when H3588 you come to check H935 . . . H6440 on H5921 my wages H7939 in the future H3117 . . . . H4279 If I have H854 any H3605 goats H5795 that H834 are not H369 speckled H5348 or spotted , H2921 or any lambs H3775 that are not dark-colored , H2345 they H1931 will be considered stolen . ” H1589"
Genesis,30,34," “ Agreed , ” H2005 . . . H3863 said H559 Laban . H3837 “ Let it be H1961 as you have said . ” H1697"
Genesis,30,35," That very H1931 - H853 day H3117 Laban removed H5493 all the streaked H6124 or spotted H2921 male goats H8495 and H853 every H3605 speckled H5348 or spotted H2921 female goat — H5795 every one H3605 that H834 had any white H3836 on it —  and every H3605 dark-colored H2345 lamb , H3775 and he placed them H5414 under the care H3027 of his sons . H1121"
Genesis,30,36," Then he put H7760 a three-day H7969 . . . H3117 journey H1870 between himself H996 . . . H996 and Jacob , H3290 while Jacob H3290 was shepherding H7462 - H853 the rest H3498 of Laban’s H3837 flocks . H6629"
Genesis,30,37," Jacob, however , H3290 took H3947 . . .  fresh H3892 branches H4731 of poplar , H3839 almond , H3869 and plane trees , H6196 and peeled H6478 [the bark] ,  exposing H4286 . . . H3836 - H834 the white H3836 inner wood H6479 of H5921 the branches . H4731"
Genesis,30,38," Then he set H3322 - H853 the peeled H6478 - H834 branches H4731 - H7298 in the watering H4325 - H834 troughs H8268 in front of H5227 the flocks H6629 coming in H935 to drink . H8354 So when the flocks H6629 were in heat H3179 and came H935 to drink , H8354"
Genesis,30,39, they H6629 mated H3179 in front of H413 the branches . H4731 And they bore H3205 young [that were] H6629 streaked H6124 or speckled H5348 or spotted . H2921
Genesis,30,40," Jacob H3290 set apart H6504 the young , H3775 but made H5414 the [rest] H6629 face H6440 . . . H413 the streaked H6124 vvv H3605 dark-colored H2345 sheep in Laban’s H3837 flocks . H6629 Then he set H7896 his own  stock H5739 apart H776 and did not H3808 put them H7896 with H5921 Laban’s H3837 animals . H6629"
Genesis,30,41," - H1961 Whenever H3605 the stronger females H7194 of the flock H6629 were in heat , H3179 Jacob H3290 - H853 would place H7760 the branches H4731 in the troughs , H7298 in full view H5869 of the animals , H6629 so that they would breed H3179 in front of the branches . H4731"
Genesis,30,42," But if the animals H6629 were weak , H5848 he did not H3808 set out the branches . H7760 So the weaker animals H5848 went to H1961 Laban H3837 and the stronger ones H7194 to Jacob . H3290"
Genesis,30,43," Thus [Jacob] H376 became H3966 exceedingly H3966 prosperous . H6555 He owned H1961 -  large H7227 flocks , H6629 maidservants H8198 and menservants , H5650 and camels H1581 and donkeys . H2543"
Genesis,31,1," Now Jacob heard H8085 - H853 that Laban’s H3837 . . . H559 sons H1121 were saying , H1697 “ Jacob H3290 - H853 has taken away H3947 all H3605 that [belonged to] H834 our father H1 and built H6213 - H853 all H3605 this H2088 wealth H3519 at H834 our father’s expense . ” H1"
Genesis,31,2, And Jacob H3290 - H853 saw H7200 from the countenance H6440 of Laban H3837 . . . H2009 that his attitude toward H5973 him H8543 . . . H8032 had changed . H369
Genesis,31,3," Then the LORD H3068 said H559 to H413 Jacob , H3290 “ Go back H7725 to H413 the land H776 of your fathers H1 and to your kindred , H4138 and I will be H1961 with you . ” H5973"
Genesis,31,4," So Jacob H3290 sent word H7971 and called H7121 Rachel H7354 and Leah H3812 to the field H7704 . . . H413 where his flocks were , H6629"
Genesis,31,5," and he told H559 them ,  “ I H595 - H853 can see H7200 from your father’s H1 countenance H6440 that H3588 his attitude toward me H413 has changed H369 . . . H8543 . . . ; H8032 but the God H430 of my father H1 has been H1961 with me . H5978"
Genesis,31,6, You H859 know H3045 that H3588 I have served H5647 - H853 your father H1 with all H3605 my strength . H3581
Genesis,31,7," And although he H1 has cheated H2048 me  and changed H2498 - H853 my wages H4909 ten H6235 times , H4489 God H430 has not H3808 allowed him H5414 to harm me . H7489 . . . H5978"
Genesis,31,8," If H518 . . . H3541 he said , H559 ‘ The speckled H5348 will be H1961 your wages , ’ H7939 then the whole H3605 flock H6629 bore H3205 speckled offspring . H5348 If H518 . . . H3541 he said , H559 ‘ The streaked H6124 will be H1961 your wages , ’ H7939 then the whole H3605 flock H6629 bore H3205 streaked offspring . H6124"
Genesis,31,9, Thus God H430 - H853 has taken away H5337 your father’s H1 livestock H4735 and given H5414 [them] to me . 
Genesis,31,10," - H1961 When H6256 the flocks H6629 were breeding , H3179 I saw H5375 . . . H5869 . . . H7200 in a dream H2472 . . . H2009 that the streaked , H6124 spotted , H1261 and speckled H5348 males H6260 were mating H5927 with H5921 the females . H6629"
Genesis,31,11," In that dream H2472 the angel H4397 of God H430 said H559 to me , H413 ‘ Jacob ! ’ H3290 And I replied , H559 ‘ Here I am. ’ H2009"
Genesis,31,12," ‘ Look up H5375 . . . H4994 . . . , ’ H5869 he said , H559 ‘ and see H7200 that all H3605 the males H6260 that are mating H5927 with H5921 the flock H6629 are streaked , H6124 spotted , H1261 or speckled ; H5348 for H3588 I have seen H7200 - H853 all H3605 that H834 Laban H3837 has done H6213 to you . "
Genesis,31,13," I H595 am the God H410 vvv H1008 of Bethel , H1008 where H834 you anointed H4886 . . . H8033 the pillar H4676 - H834 and made H5087 . . . H8033 a solemn vow H5088 to Me .  Now H6258 get up H6965 and leave H3318 . . . H4480 this H2063 land {at once} , H776 and return H7725 to H413 your native H4138 land . ’” H776"
Genesis,31,14," And Rachel H7354 and Leah H3812 replied H6030 . . . H559 ,  “ Do we  have any portion H2506 or inheritance H5159 left H5750 in our father’s H1 house ? H1004"
Genesis,31,15," Are we not H3808 regarded H2803 by him  as outsiders ? H5237 Not only H3588 has he sold us , H4376 but he has H1571 certainly squandered H398 . . . H398 - H853 what was paid for us . H3701"
Genesis,31,16, Surely H3588 all H3605 the wealth H6239 that H834 God H430 has taken away H5337 from our father H1 belongs to us  . . . H1931 and to our children . H1121 So H6258 do H6213 whatever H3605 - H834 God H430 has told H559 you . ” H413
Genesis,31,17," Then Jacob H3290 got up H6965 and put H5375 - H853 his children H1121 - H853 and his wives H802 on H5921 camels , H1581"
Genesis,31,18," and he drove H5090 - H853 all H3605 his livestock {before him} , H4735 - H853 - H4735 . . . H7075 - H834 - H7408 . . . H6307 along with all H3605 the possessions H7399 - H834 he had acquired H7408 in Paddan-aram , H758 to go H935 to H413 his father H1 Isaac H3327 in the land H776 in Canaan . H3667"
Genesis,31,19," Now while Laban H3837 was out H1980 shearing H1494 - H853 his sheep , H6629 Rachel H7354 - H853 stole H1589 her father’s H1 household idols H8655 - . H834"
Genesis,31,20," Moreover, Jacob H3290 - H853 deceived H1589 . . . H3820 Laban H3837 the Aramean H761 . . . H5921 by not H1097 telling H5046 him  that H3588 he H1931 was running away . H1272"
Genesis,31,21," So he H1931 fled H1272 with all H3605 his possessions H834 ,  - H6965 crossed H5674 - H853 the Euphrates , H5104 and headed for H7760 - H853 - H6440 the hill country H2022 of Gilead . H1568"
Genesis,31,22, On the third H7992 day H3117 Laban H3837 was informed H5046 that H3588 Jacob H3290 had fled . H1272
Genesis,31,23," So he took H3947 - H853 his relatives H251 with him , H5973 pursued H7291 Jacob H310 . . . H1870 for seven H7651 days , H3117 and overtook H1692 him H853 in the hill country H2022 of Gilead . H1568"
Genesis,31,24," But that night H3915 God H430 came H935 to H413 Laban H3837 the Aramean H761 in a dream H2472 and warned H559 him ,  “ Be careful H8104 not H6435 to say H1696 anything to H5973 Jacob , H3290 either good H2896 or H5704 bad . ” H7451"
Genesis,31,25," Now Jacob H3290 had pitched H8628 - H853 his tent H168 in the hill country H2022 of Gilead H1568 when Laban H3837 - H853 overtook H5381 [him] , H3290 and Laban H3837 and his relatives H251 camped H8628 . . . H854 [there as well] . H2022"
Genesis,31,26," Then Laban H3837 said H559 to Jacob , H3290 “ What H4100 have you done ? H6213 You have deceived H1589 me H853 . . . H3824 and carried off my daughters H1323 . . . H5090 - H853 like captives H7617 of war ! H2719"
Genesis,31,27," Why H4100 did you run away H1272 secretly H2244 and deceive H1589 me , H853 without even H3808 telling H5046 me ?  I would have sent you away H7971 with joy H8057 and singing , H7892 with tambourines H8596 and harps . H3658"
Genesis,31,28, But you did not H3808 even let me H5203 kiss H5401 my grandchildren H1121 and my daughters { goodbye } . H1323 Now H6258 you have done H6213 a foolish thing . H5528
Genesis,31,29," - H3426 I have power to do H6213 . . . H410 . . . H3027 you H5973 great harm , H7451 but last night H570 the God H430 of your father H1 said H559 to me H413 . . . , H559 ‘ Be careful H8104 not to say H1696 anything to H5973 Jacob , H3290 either good H2896 or H5704 bad . ’ H7451"
Genesis,31,30, Now H6258 you have gone off H1980 . . . H1980 because H3588 you long H3700 . . . H3700 for your father’s H1 house . H1004 But why H4100 have you stolen H1589 - H853 my gods ? ” H430
Genesis,31,31," “ vvv H3588 I was afraid , ” H3372 Jacob H3290 answered , H6030 “ for H3588 . . . H559 . . . H6435 I thought H559 [you] H3837 would take your daughters H1323 from me H5973 by force . H1497 - H853"
Genesis,31,32," If you find H4672 - H853 your gods H430 with H5973 anyone here , H834 he shall not H3808 live ! H2421 In the presence of H5048 our relatives , H251 see H5234 for yourself  if anything H4100 is yours , H5978 and take H3947 it back . ”  For Jacob H3290 did not H3808 know H3045 that H3588 Rachel H7354 had stolen [the idols] . H1589"
Genesis,31,33," So Laban H3837 went H935 into Jacob’s H3290 tent , H168 then Leah’s H3812 tent , H168 and then the tents H168 of the two H8147 maidservants , H519 but he found H4672 nothing . H3808 Then he left H3318 Leah’s H3812 tent H168 and entered H935 Rachel’s H7354 tent . H168"
Genesis,31,34," Now Rachel H7354 had taken H3947 - H853 Laban’s household idols , H8655 put them H7760 in the saddlebag H3733 of her camel , H1581 and was sitting H3427 on them . H5921 And Laban H3837 - H853 searched H4959 everything H3605 in the tent H168 but found H4672 nothing . H3808"
Genesis,31,35," [Rachel] said H559 to H413 her father , H1 “ Sir , H113 do not H408 be angry H2734 . . . H5869 that H3588 I cannot H3808 . . . H3201 stand up H6965 before you ; H6440 for H3588 I am having my period H1870 . . . H802 . ”  So Laban searched , H2664 but could not H3808 find H4672 - H853 the household idols . H8655"
Genesis,31,36, Then Jacob H3290 became incensed H2734 and challenged H7378 Laban . H3837 . . . H6030 “ What H4100 is my crime ? ” H6588 he H3290 said . H559 - H3837 “ For what H4100 sin of mine H2403 - H3588 have you so hotly pursued H1814 me ? H310
Genesis,31,37," - H3588 You have searched H4959 - H853 all H3605 my goods ! H3627 . . . H4100 Have you found H4672 anything H3605 that belongs to you ? H3627 . . . H1004 Put H7760 it here H3541 before H5048 my brothers H251 and yours , H251 that they may judge H3198 between H996 the two of us . H8147"
Genesis,31,38," I have H595 been with H5973 you for H2088 twenty H6242 years now . H8141 Your sheep H7353 and goats H5795 have not H3808 miscarried , H7921 nor have I H3808 eaten H398 the rams H352 of your flock . H6629"
Genesis,31,39, I did not H3808 bring H935 you H413 anything torn by wild beasts ; H2966 I H595 bore the loss myself . H2398 And you demanded H1245 payment from me H3027 for what was stolen H1589 by day H3117 . . . H1589 or night . H3915
Genesis,31,40," As it was , H1961 the heat H2721 consumed me H398 by day H3117 and the frost H7140 by night , H3915 and sleep H8142 fled H5074 from my eyes . H5869"
Genesis,31,41, Thus H2088 -  for twenty H6242 years H8141 I have served H5647 in your household — H1004 fourteen H702 . . . H6240 years H8141 for your two H8147 daughters H1323 and six H8337 years H8141 for your flocks — H6629 and you have changed H2498 - H853 my wages H4909 ten H6235 times ! H4489
Genesis,31,42," If the God H430 of my father , H1 the God H430 of Abraham H85 and the Fear H6343 of Isaac , H3327 had not H3884 been H1961 with me ,  surely H3588 by now H6258 you would have sent me away H7971 - H853 empty-handed . H7387 But God H430 has seen H7200 my affliction H6040 - H853 and the toil H3018 of my hands , H3709 and last night H570 He rendered judgment . ” H3198"
Genesis,31,43," But Laban H3837 . . . H559 . . . H413 answered H6030 Jacob , H3290 “ [These] daughters H1323 are my daughters , H1323 [these] sons H1121 [are] my sons , H1121 and [these] flocks H6629 [are] my flocks !

Genesis,31,44," Come H1980 now , H6258 let us make H3772 a covenant , H1285 you H859 and I , H589 and let it serve as H1961 a witness H5707 between you and me H996 . . . . ” H996"
Genesis,31,45," So Jacob H3290 picked out H3947 a stone H68 and set it up H7311 as a pillar , H4676"
Genesis,31,46," and [he] H3290 said H559 to his relatives , H251 “ Gather H3950 [some] stones . ” H68 So they took H3947 stones H68 and made H6213 a mound , H1530 and there H8033 by H5921 the mound H1530 they ate . H398"
Genesis,31,47," Laban H3837 called it H7121 . . .  vvv H3026 Jegar-sahadutha , H3026 and Jacob H3290 called it H7121 . . .  Galeed . H1567"

Genesis,31,49," [It was] also [called] Mizpah , H4709 because H834 [Laban] said , H559 “ May the LORD H3068 keep watch H6822 between you H996 and me H996 when H3588 we are absent H5641 from each other H7453 . . . . H376"

Genesis,31,53," May the God H430 of Abraham H85 and the God H430 of Nahor , H5152 the God H430 of their father , H1 judge H8199 between us . ” H996 So Jacob H3290 swore H7650 by the Fear H6343 of his father H1 Isaac . H3327"
Genesis,31,54," Then Jacob H3290 offered H2076 a sacrifice H2077 on the mountain H2022 and invited H7121 his relatives H251 to eat H398 a meal . H3899 And after they had eaten H398 . . . , H3899 they spent the night H3885 on the mountain . H2022"
Genesis,31,55," Early the next morning , H1242 Laban H3837 got up H7925 and kissed H5401 his grandchildren H1121 and daughters H1323 and blessed them . H1288 - H853 Then [he] H3837 left H1980 to return H7725 home . H4725"
Genesis,32,1," Jacob also H3290 went H1980 on his way , H1870 and the angels H4397 of God H430 met H6293 him . "
Genesis,32,2," When H834 [Jacob] saw them , H7200 [he] H3290 said , H559 “ This H2088 is the camp H4264 of God . ” H430 So he named H7121 . . . H8034 that H1931 place H4725 Mahanaim . H4266"
Genesis,32,3," Jacob H3290 sent H7971 messengers H4397 ahead of him H6440 to H413 his brother H251 Esau H6215 in the land H776 of Seir , H8165 the country H7704 of Edom . H123"
Genesis,32,4," He instructed them , H6680 - H853 “ You are to say H559 . . . H3541 . . . H559 to my master H113 Esau H6215 . . . , H3541 ‘ Your servant H5650 Jacob H3290 says : H559 I have been staying H1481 with H5973 Laban H3837 and have remained there H309 until H5704 now . H6258"

Genesis,32,6," When the messengers H4397 returned H7725 to H413 Jacob , H3290 they said , H559 “ We went H935 to H413 your brother H251 . . . H413 Esau , H6215 and now H1571 he is coming H1980 to meet you — H7122 he and four H702 hundred H3967 men H376 with him . ” H5973"
Genesis,32,7," In great H3966 fear H3372 and distress , H3334 Jacob H3290 divided H2673 - H834 his H854 - H853 people H5971 - H853 into two H8147 camps , H4264 as well as the flocks H6629 - H853 and herds H1241 and camels . H1581"
Genesis,32,8," He thought , H559 “ If H518 Esau H6215 comes H935 and attacks H5221 - H413 one H259 camp , H4264 then H1961 the other H7604 camp H4264 can escape . ” H6413"
Genesis,32,9," Then Jacob H3290 declared , H559 “ O God H430 of my father H1 Abraham , H85 God H430 of my father H1 Isaac , H3327 the LORD H3068 who told H559 me , H413 ‘ Go back H7725 to your country H776 and to your kindred , H4138 and I will make you prosper , ’ H3190 . . . H5973"
Genesis,32,10," I am unworthy H6994 of all H3605 the kindness H2617 . . . H3605 and faithfulness H571 - H834 You have shown H6213 . . . H854 Your servant .

Genesis,32,11," Please H4994 deliver me H5337 from the hand H3027 of my brother H251 . . . H3027 Esau , H6215 for H3588 I H595 - H853 am afraid that H3373 vvv H6435 he may come H935 and attack me H5221 and the mothers H517 and H5921 children [with me] . H1121"

Genesis,32,13," [Jacob] spent H3885 the H1931 night H3915 there , H8033 and from what he had brought H935 with him , H3027 he selected H3947 . . . H4480 a gift H4503 for his brother H251 Esau : H6215"
Genesis,32,14," 200 H3967 female goats , H5795 20 H6242 male goats , H8495 200 H3967 ewes , H7353 20 H6242 rams , H352"

Genesis,32,16," He entrusted them to H5414 . . . H3027 his servants H5650 in separate H905 herds H5739 . . . H5739 and told H559 . . . H413 them , H5650 “ Go on H5674 ahead of me , H6440 and keep H7760 some distance H7305 between H996 the herds H5739 . . . H996 . . . . ” H5739"
Genesis,32,17," He instructed H6680 - H853 the one in the lead H7223 . . . , H559 “ When H3588 my brother H251 Esau H6215 meets H6298 you and asks , H7592 . . . H559 ‘ To whom H4310 do you belong , H859 where H575 are you going , H1980 and whose H4310 animals are these H428 before you ? ’ H6440"
Genesis,32,18," then you are to say , H559 ‘ They belong to your servant H5650 Jacob . H3290 They H1931 are a gift , H4503 sent H7971 to my lord H113 Esau . H6215 And behold , H2009 . . . H1571 [Jacob] H1931 is behind us . ’” H310"
Genesis,32,19," He also H1571 - H853 instructed H6680 the second , H8145 the third , H7992 . . . H1571 - H853 and H1571 - H853 all those H3605 following H1980 behind H310 the herds H5739 . . . : H559 “ When you meet H4672 Esau , H6215 you are to say H1696 the same H2088 thing H1697 to H413 him . H853"
Genesis,32,20," You are also H1571 to say , H559 ‘ Look , H2009 your servant H5650 Jacob H3290 is right behind us . ’” H310 For H3588 he thought , H559 “ I will appease H3722 [Esau] H6440 with the gift H4503 that is going H1980 before me . H6440 After H310 that H3651 I can face H7200 him , H6440 and perhaps H194 he will accept H5375 me . ” H6440"
Genesis,32,21," So [Jacob’s] gifts H4503 went H5674 on before H5921 him , H6440 while he H1931 spent H3885 the H1931 night H3915 in the camp . H4264"
Genesis,32,22," During the night H3915 . . . H1931 Jacob got up H6965 and took H3947 - H853 his two H8147 wives , H802 - H853 his two H8147 maidservants , H8198 - H853 and his eleven H259 . . . H6240 sons , H3206 and crossed H5674 - H853 the ford H4569 of the Jabbok . H2999"
Genesis,32,23," He took them H3947 and sent them across H5674 - H853 the stream , H5158 . . . H5674 - H853 along with all his possessions H834 . "
Genesis,32,24," So Jacob H3290 was left H3498 all alone , H905 and [there] a man H376 wrestled H79 with him H5973 until H5704 daybreak H5927 . . . . H7837"
Genesis,32,25," When the man saw H7200 that H3588 he could not H3808 overpower H3201 [Jacob] ,  he struck H5060 the socket H3709 of Jacob’s hip H3409 and dislocated H3363 . . . H3709 [it] H3290 . . . H3409 as they H5973 wrestled . H79"
Genesis,32,26," Then [the man] said , H559 “ Let me go , H7971 for H3588 it is daybreak H5927 . . . . ” H7837 But Jacob replied , H559 “ I will not H3808 let you go H7971 unless H3588 . . . H518 you bless me . ” H1288"
Genesis,32,27," “ What H4100 is your name ? ” H8034 the man asked . H559 . . . H413 “ Jacob , ” H3290 he replied . H559"
Genesis,32,28," Then [the man] said , H559 “ Your name H8034 will no H3808 longer H5750 be H559 Jacob , H3290 but Israel H3478 . . . , H3588 because H3588 . . . H518 you have struggled H8280 with H5973 God H430 and with H5973 men , H376 and you have prevailed . ” H3201"
Genesis,32,29," And Jacob H3290 requested H7592 . . . , H559 “ Please H4994 tell me H5046 your name . ” H8034 But he replied , H559 “ Why H4100 . . . H2088 do you ask H7592 my name ? ” H8034 Then he blessed H1288 [Jacob] H853 there . H8033"
Genesis,32,30," So Jacob H3290 named H7121 . . . H8034 the place H4725 Peniel , H6439 saying, “Indeed , H3588 I have seen H7200 God H430 face H6440 to H413 face , H6440 and yet my life H5315 was spared . ” H5337"
Genesis,32,31," The sun H8121 rose H2224 above him  as H834 he passed by H5674 - H853 Penuel , H6439 and he H1931 was limping H6760 because of H5921 his hip . H3409"
Genesis,32,32," Therefore H5921 . . . H3651 to H5704 this H2088 day H3117 the Israelites H1121 . . . H3478 - H853 do not H3808 eat H398 the tendon H1517 . . . H5384 which [is] H834 at H5921 the socket H3709 of the hip , H3409 because H3588 the socket H3709 of Jacob’s H3290 hip H3409 was struck H5060 near that tendon H1517 . . . . H5384"
Genesis,33,1," Now Jacob H3290 looked up H5375 . . . H5869 and saw H7200 . . . H2009 Esau H6215 coming H935 toward him with H5973 four H702 hundred H3967 men . H376 So he divided H2673 - H853 the children H3206 . . . H5921 among Leah , H3812 . . . H5921 Rachel , H7354 . . . H5921 and the two H8147 maidservants . H8198"
Genesis,33,2," He put H7760 - H853 the maidservants H8198 and their H853 children H3206 in front , H7223 - H853 Leah H3812 and her children H3206 next , H314 - H853 and Rachel H7354 - H853 and Joseph H3130 at the rear . H314"
Genesis,33,3, But [Jacob] himself H1931 went on H5674 ahead H6440 and bowed H7812 to the ground H776 seven H7651 times H6471 as H5704 he approached H5066 . . . H5704 his brother . H251
Genesis,33,4," Esau, however , H6215 . . . H7122 ran to him H7323 and embraced him , H2263 threw his arms around H5307 . . . H5921 his neck , H6677 and kissed him . H5401 And they both wept . H1058"
Genesis,33,5," When Esau looked up H5375 - H853 - H5869 and saw H7200 - H853 the women H802 - H853 and children , H3206 he asked , H559 “ Who H4310 are these H428 with you ? ”  [Jacob] answered , H559 “ [These are] the children H3206 - H834 God H430 - H853 has graciously given H2603 your servant . ” H5650"
Genesis,33,6, Then the maidservants H8198 and their H2007 children H3206 approached H5066 and bowed down . H7812
Genesis,33,7," Leah H3812 and her children H3206 also H1571 approached H5066 and bowed down , H7812 and then H310 Joseph H3130 and Rachel H7354 approached H5066 and bowed down . H7812"
Genesis,33,8," “ What H4310 do you mean  by sending this H2088 - H834 whole H3605 company H4264 to meet me ? ” H6298 asked Esau . H559 “ To find H4672 favor H2580 in your sight , H5869 my lord , ” H113 [Jacob] answered . H559"
Genesis,33,9," “ I already have H3426 plenty , H7227 my brother , ” H251 Esau H6215 replied . H559 “ Keep H1961 what belongs H834 to you . ” "
Genesis,33,10," But Jacob H3290 insisted , H559 “ No , H408 please ! H4994 If H518 . . . H4994 I have found H4672 favor H2580 in your sight , H5869 then receive H3947 this gift H4503 from my hand . H3027 For H5921 . . . H3651 indeed , H3588 I have seen H7200 your face , H6440 and it is like seeing H7200 the face H6440 of God , H430 since you have received me favorably . H7521"
Genesis,33,11," Please H4994 - H853 accept H3947 my gift H1293 that H834 was brought H935 to you ,  because H3588 God H430 . . . H3588 has been gracious H2603 to me  and I have H3426 all I need . ” H3605 So Jacob pressed H6484 him  until he accepted . H3947"
Genesis,33,12," Then Esau said , H559 “ Let us be on our way H5265 . . . , H1980 and I will go H1980 ahead of you . ” H5048"
Genesis,33,13," But Jacob replied H559 . . . , H413 “ My lord H113 knows H3045 that H3588 the children H3206 are frail , H7390 and I must care for H5921 sheep H6629 and cattle H1241 that are nursing their young .

Genesis,33,16," So that H1931 day H3117 Esau H6215 started on his way H1870 back H7725 to Seir , H8165"
Genesis,33,17," but Jacob H3290 went on H5265 to Succoth , H5523 where he built H1129 a house H1004 for himself  and shelters H5521 for his livestock ; H4735 . . . H6213 that is why H5921 . . . H3651 the place H4725 was called H7121 . . . H8034 Succoth . H5523"
Genesis,33,18," After Jacob H3290 had come H935 vvv H6307 from Paddan-aram , H758 he arrived H935 safely H8003 at the city H5892 of Shechem H7927 - H834 in the land H776 of Canaan , H3667 and he camped H2583 . . . H854 just outside H6440 the city . H5892"
Genesis,33,19," And the plot H2513 of ground H7704 where H834 he pitched H5186 . . . H8033 his tent , H168 he purchased H7069 - H853 from H3027 the sons H1121 of Hamor , H2544 Shechem’s H7927 father , H1 for a hundred H3967 pieces of silver . H7192"

Genesis,39,2," And the LORD H3068 was H1961 with H854 Joseph , H3130 and he became H1961 a successful H6743 man , H376 serving H1961 in the household H1004 of his Egyptian H4713 master . H113"

Genesis,39,6," So [Potiphar] left H5800 all H3605 that H834 he owned  in Joseph’s H3130 care ; H3027 he did not H3808 concern himself H3045 . . . H854 with anything H3972 except H3588 . . . H518 the food H3899 - H834 he H1931 ate . H398 Now Joseph H3130 was H1961 well-built H3303 . . . H8389 and handsome H3303 . . . , H4758"

Genesis,39,10," Although H1961 [Potiphar’s wife] spoke H1696 to H413 Joseph H3130 day H3117 after day , H3117 he refused H3808 . . . H8085 . . . H413 to go to bed H7901 with her H681 [or even] be H1961 near her . H5973"
Genesis,39,11," One day H3117 . . . , H2088 however , H1961 [Joseph] went H935 into the house H1004 to attend to H6213 his work , H4399 and not H369 a single H376 household H1004 servant H582 [was] H8033 inside . H1004"

Genesis,40,11," Pharaoh’s H6547 cup H3563 was in my hand , H3027 and I took H3947 - H853 the grapes , H6025 squeezed H7818 them H853 into H413 [his] H6547 cup , H3563 and placed H5414 - H853 the cup H3563 in H5921 [his] H6547 hand . ” H3709"

Genesis,41,24," And the thin H1851 - H853 heads of grain H7641 swallowed H1104 the seven H7651 plump H2896 ones . H7641 I told H559 this [dream] to H413 the magicians , H2748 but no H369 one could explain it H5046 to me . ” "
Genesis,41,25," At this, Joseph H3130 said H559 to H413 Pharaoh , H6547 “ The dreams H2472 of Pharaoh H6547 are one and the same . H259 . . . H1931 - H853 God H430 has revealed H5046 to Pharaoh H6547 what H834 He is about to do . H6213"
Genesis,41,26," The seven H7651 good H2896 cows H6510 are seven H7651 years , H8141 . . . H2007 and the seven H7651 ripe H2896 heads of grain H7641 are seven H7651 years . H8141 . . . H2007 The dreams H2472 have the same meaning H259 . . . . H1931"
Genesis,41,27," Moreover, the seven H7651 thin , H7534 ugly H7451 cows H6510 that came up H5927 after them H310 are seven H7651 years , H8141 and so are H2007 the seven H7651 worthless H7386 heads of grain H7641 scorched H7710 by the east wind — H6921 they are H1961 seven H7651 years H8141 of famine . H7458"
Genesis,41,28, It H1931 . . . H1697 is just as H834 I said H1696 to H413 Pharaoh : H6547 God H430 has shown H7200 - H853 Pharaoh H6547 what H834 He is about to do . H6213
Genesis,41,29," Behold , H2009 seven H7651 years H8141 of great H1419 abundance H7647 are coming H935 throughout H3605 the land H776 of Egypt , H4714"
Genesis,41,30," but seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458 will follow H6965 them . H310 Then all H3605 the abundance H7647 in the land H776 of Egypt H4714 will be forgotten , H7911 and the famine H7458 - H853 will devastate H3615 the land . H776"
Genesis,41,31," The abundance H7647 in the land H776 will not H3808 be remembered , H3045 since H6440 the H1931 famine H7458 that follows H310 it H3651 - H3588 [will be] so H3966 severe H3515 - . H1931"
Genesis,41,32," Moreover , H5921 because H3588 the dream H2472 was given H6471 to H413 Pharaoh H6547 in two versions , H8138 the matter H1697 has been decreed H3559 by H5973 God , H430 and He H430 will carry it out H6213 shortly . H4116"
Genesis,41,33," Now, therefore , H6258 Pharaoh H6547 should look for H7200 a discerning H995 and wise H2450 man H376 and set him H7896 over H5921 the land H776 of Egypt . H4714"
Genesis,41,34, Let Pharaoh H6547 take action H6213 and appoint H6485 commissioners H6496 over H5921 the land H776 to take a fifth H2567 - H853 of the harvest H776 of Egypt H4714 during the seven H7651 years H8141 of abundance . H7647
Genesis,41,35," Under H8478 the authority H3027 of Pharaoh , H6547 let them collect H6908 - H853 all H3605 the excess food H400 from these H428 good H2896 years , H8141 that they may come H935 and lay up H6651 the grain H1250 to be preserved H8104 as food H400 in the cities . H5892"
Genesis,41,36, This food H400 will be H1961 a reserve H6487 for the land H776 during the seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458 - H834 to come H1961 upon the land H776 of Egypt . H4714 Then the country H776 will not H3808 perish H3772 in the famine . ” H7458
Genesis,41,37, This proposal H1697 pleased H3190 . . . H5869 Pharaoh H6547 . . . H5869 and all H3605 his officials . H5650
Genesis,41,38," So Pharaoh H6547 asked H559 . . . H413 [them] , H5650 “ Can we find H4672 anyone like this H2088 man , H376 in whom H834 the Spirit H7307 of God H430 [abides] ?” "
Genesis,41,39," Then Pharaoh H6547 said H559 to H413 Joseph , H3130 “ Since H310 God H430 - H853 - H853 has made all H3605 this H2063 known to you , H3045 there is no one H369 as discerning H995 and wise H2450 as you . H3644"
Genesis,41,40," You H859 shall be H1961 in charge of H5921 my house , H1004 . . . H5921 and all H3605 my people H5971 are to obey H5401 your commands . H6310 Only H7535 with regard to the throne H3678 will I be greater H1431 than you . ” H4480"
Genesis,41,41," Pharaoh H6547 also told H559 . . . H413 Joseph , H3130 “ vvv H7200 I hereby place H5414 - H853 you over H5921 all H3605 the land H776 of Egypt . ” H4714"
Genesis,41,42," Then Pharaoh H6547 - H853 removed H5493 the signet ring H2885 from H5921 his finger , H3027 put H5414 - H853 it on H5921 Joseph’s H3130 finger , H3027 clothed H3847 him H853 in garments H899 of fine linen , H8336 and placed H7760 a gold H2091 chain H7242 around H5921 his neck . H6677"
Genesis,41,43," He had Joseph ride H7392 - H853 in his second H4932 - H834 -  chariot , H4818 with men calling out H7121 before him , H6440 “ Bow the knee ! ” H86 So he placed H5414 him H853 over H5921 all H3605 the land H776 of Egypt . H4714"
Genesis,41,44," And Pharaoh H6547 declared H559 to H413 Joseph , H3130 “ I H589 am Pharaoh , H6547 but without your permission , H1107 no H3808 one H376 - H853 in all H3605 the land H776 of Egypt H4714 shall lift H7311 his hand H3027 or H853 foot . ” H7272"
Genesis,41,45," Pharaoh H6547 gave H7121 Joseph H3130 the name H8034 vvv H6847 Zaphenath-paneah , H6847 and he gave H5414 him  - H853 Asenath H621 daughter H1323 vvv H6319 of Potiphera , H6319 priest H3548 of On , H204 to be his wife . H802 And Joseph H3130 took charge H3318 of [all] H5921 the land H776 of Egypt . H4714"
Genesis,41,46, Now Joseph H3130 was thirty H7970 years old H1121 . . . H8141 when he entered the service H5975 . . . H6440 of Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt . H4714 And Joseph H3130 left H3318 Pharaoh’s H6547 presence H6440 and traveled H5674 throughout H3605 the land H776 of Egypt . H4714
Genesis,41,47," During the seven H7651 years H8141 of abundance , H7647 the land H776 brought forth H6213 bountifully . H7062"
Genesis,41,48," During those seven H7651 years , H8141 Joseph collected H6908 - H853 all H3605 the excess food H400 in the land H776 of Egypt H4714 - H834 - H1961 and stored H5414 it H400 in the cities . H5892 In every city H5892 he laid up H5414 the food H400 - H834 from the fields H7704 around it H5439 . H8432"
Genesis,41,49," So Joseph H3130 stored up H6651 grain H1250 in such abundance H7235 . . . , H3966 . . . H5704 like the sand H2344 of the sea , H3220 that H3588 he stopped H2308 keeping track of it ; H5608 for H3588 it was beyond H369 measure . H4557"
Genesis,41,50," Before H2962 the years H8141 of famine H7458 - H834 arrived , H935 two H8147 sons H1121 were born H3205 to Joseph H3130 by Asenath H621 daughter H1323 vvv H6319 of Potiphera , H6319 priest H3548 of On H204 - H3205 - . "

Genesis,41,54," the seven H7651 years H8141 of famine H7458 . . . H935 began , H2490 just as H834 Joseph H3130 had said . H559 And although there was H1961 famine H7458 in every H3605 country , H776 there was H1961 food H3899 throughout H3605 the land H776 of Egypt . H4714"
Genesis,41,55," When extreme hunger H7456 came to all H3605 the land H776 of Egypt H4714 and the people H5971 cried out H6817 to H413 Pharaoh H6547 for food , H3899 [he] H6547 told H559 all H3605 the Egyptians , H4713 “ Go H1980 to H413 Joseph H3130 and do H6213 whatever H834 he tells H559 you . ” "
Genesis,41,56," When the famine H7458 had spread H1961 over H5921 all H3605 the H6440 land , H776 Joseph H3130 - H853 opened up H6605 all H3605 the storehouses H834 and sold grain H7666 to the Egyptians ; H4714 for the famine H7458 was severe H2388 in the land H776 of Egypt . H4714"
Genesis,41,57," And every H3605 nation H776 came H935 to H413 Joseph H3130 in Egypt H4714 to buy grain , H7666 because H3588 the famine H7458 was severe H2388 over all H3605 the earth . H776"
Genesis,42,1," When Jacob H3290 learned H7200 that H3588 there was H3426 grain H7668 in Egypt , H4714 he H3290 said H559 to his sons , H1121 “ Why H4100 are you staring at one another ? ” H7200"
Genesis,42,2," “ Look , ” H2009 he added , H559 “ I have heard H8085 that H3588 there is H3426 grain H7668 in Egypt . H4714 Go down H3381 there H8033 and buy H7666 some for us  . . . , H8033 so that we may live H2421 and not H3808 die . ” H4191"
Genesis,42,3, So ten H6235 of Joseph’s H3130 brothers H251 went down H3381 to buy H7666 grain H1250 from Egypt . H4714
Genesis,42,4," - H853 But Jacob H3290 did not H3808 send H7971 Joseph’s H3130 brother H251 Benjamin H1144 with H854 his brothers , H251 for H3588 he said , H559 “ I am afraid that H6435 harm H611 might befall him . ” H7122"
Genesis,42,5," So the sons H1121 of Israel H3478 were among H8432 those who H935 came H935 to buy grain , H7666 since H3588 the famine H7458 had [also] spread H1961 to the land H776 of Canaan . H3667"
Genesis,42,6," Now Joseph H3130 was H1931 the ruler H7989 of H5921 the land ; H776 [he was the one] who H1931 sold grain H7666 to all H3605 its H776 people . H5971 So when [his] H3130 brothers H251 arrived , H935 they bowed down H7812 before him  with their faces H639 to the ground . H776"
Genesis,42,7," And when Joseph H3130 - H853 saw H7200 his brothers , H251 he recognized them , H5234 but he treated them as strangers H5234 . . . H413 and spoke H1696 harshly H7186 to them . H854 “ Where H370 have you come from ? ” H935 he asked H559 . . . . H413 “ From the land H776 of Canaan , ” H3667 they replied . H559 “ [We are here] to buy H7666 food . ” H400"
Genesis,42,8," Although Joseph H3130 - H853 recognized H5234 his brothers , H251 they H1992 did not H3808 recognize him . H5234"
Genesis,42,9," Joseph H3130 - H853 remembered H2142 his dreams H2472 - H834 - H2492 about them  and said H559 . . . , H413 “ You H859 are spies ! H7270 You have come H935 to see H7200 - H853 if our land H776 [is] vulnerable . ” H6172"
Genesis,42,10," “ Not so , H3808 my lord , ” H113 they replied H559 . . . . H413 “ Your servants H5650 have come H935 to buy H7666 food . H400"

Genesis,42,13," But they answered , H559 “ Your servants H5650 . . . H587 are twelve H8147 . . . H6240 brothers , H251 the sons H1121 of one H259 man H376 in the land H776 of Canaan . H3667 . . . H2009 The youngest H6996 is now H3117 with H854 our father , H1 and one H259 is no more . ” H369"
Genesis,42,14," Then Joseph H3130 . . . H1931 - H834 declared H559 . . . , H413 “ Just as I said H1696 . . . H413 . . . , H559 you H859 are spies ! H7270"
Genesis,42,15," And this is how H2063 you will be tested : H974 As surely as Pharaoh H6547 lives , H2416 you shall not H518 leave H3318 this H2088 place unless H3588 . . . H518 your youngest H6996 brother H251 comes H935 here . H2008"
Genesis,42,16," Send H7971 one H259 of your number  to get H3947 - H853 your brother ; H251 the rest of you H859 will be confined H631 so that the truth H571 of your words H1697 may be tested . H974 . . . H854 If H518 they are untrue , H3808 then as surely as Pharaoh H6547 . . . H3588 lives , H2416 you H859 are spies ! ” H7270"
Genesis,42,17," So Joseph imprisoned them H622 - H853 - H413 . . . H4929 for three H7969 days , H3117"
Genesis,42,18," and on the third H7992 day H3117 [he] H3130 said H559 to them , H413 - H853 “ I H589 fear H3373 God . H430 So do H6213 this H2063 and you will live : H2421"
Genesis,42,19," If H518 you H859 . . . H251 are honest , H3651 leave one H259 of your brothers in custody H631 . . . H1004 . . . H4929 while the rest of you H859 go H1980 and take back H935 grain H7668 to relieve the hunger H7459 of your households . H1004"
Genesis,42,20," Then H853 bring H935 your youngest H6996 brother H251 to me H413 so that your words H1697 can be verified , H539 that you may not H3808 die . ” H4191 And to this H3651 they consented . H6213"
Genesis,42,21," Then they said H559 to H413 one H376 another , H251 “ Surely H61 we H587 are being punished H818 because of H5921 our brother . H251 - H834 We saw H7200 his H5315 anguish H6869 when he pleaded H2603 with us , H413 but we would not H3808 listen . H8085 That is why H5921 . . .

Genesis,42,22," And Reuben H7205 - H853 responded , H6030 “ Didn’t H3808 . . . H559 . . . H413 . . . H559 I tell H559 you not H408 to sin against H2398 the boy ? H3206 But you would not H3808 listen . H8085 . . . H1571 Now H2009 we must account for H1875 his blood ! ” H1818"

Genesis,42,25," Then Joseph H3130 gave orders H6680 to fill their bags H3627 with H4390 - H853 grain , H1250 to return H7725 each man’s H376 silver H3701 to H413 his sack , H8242 and to give H5414 them  provisions H6720 for their journey . H1870 This H3651 order was carried out H6213 , "
Genesis,42,26, and they loaded H5375 - H853 the grain H7668 on H5921 their donkeys H2543 and departed H1980 . . . . H8033
Genesis,42,27," At the place where they lodged for the night , H4411 one H259 - H853 of them opened H6605 his sack H8242 to get H5414 feed H4554 for his donkey , H2543 and he saw H7200 - H853 his silver H3701 . . . H2009 . . . H1931 in the mouth H6310 of the sack . H572"
Genesis,42,28," “ My silver H3701 . . . H1571 has been returned ! ” H7725 he said H559 to H413 his brothers .

Genesis,42,29," When they reached H935 . . . H413 their father H1 Jacob H3290 in the land H776 of Canaan , H3667 they described H5046 to  him H853 all H3605 that had happened to them H7136 - H853 - : H559"
Genesis,42,30, “ The man H376 who is lord H113 of the land H776 spoke H1696 harshly H7186 . . . H5414 - H853 to us H854 and accused us of spying H7270 - H853 on the country . H776

Genesis,43,4," If H518 . . . H3426 you will send H7971 - H853 our brother H251 with us , H854 we will go down H3381 and buy H7666 food H400 for you . "
Genesis,43,5," But if H518 you will not H369 send him , H7971 we will not H3808 go ; H3381 for H3588 the man H376 told H559 us , H413 ‘ You will not H3808 see H7200 my face H6440 again unless H1115 your brother H251 is with you . ’” H854"
Genesis,43,6, “ Why H4100 did you bring this trouble H7489 upon me ? ”  Israel H3478 asked . H559 “ Why did you tell H5046 the man H376 you had another H5750 . . .  brother ? ” H251
Genesis,43,7," They replied , H559 “ The man H376 questioned H7592 us  in detail H7592 about ourselves and our family H4138 : H559 ‘ Is your father H1 still H5750 alive ? H2416 Do you have H3426 . . .  another brother ? ’ H251 And we answered H5046 him  accordingly H5921 . . . . H6310 . . . H1697 . . . H428 How could we possibly know H3045 . . . H3045 that H3588 he would say , H559 ‘ Bring H3381 - H853 your brother here ’? ” H251"
Genesis,43,8," And Judah H3063 said H559 to H413 his father H1 Israel , H3478 “ Send H7971 the boy H5288 with me , H854 vvv H6965 and we will go at once , H1980 so that we may live H2421 and not H3808 die — H4191 . . . H1571 neither we , H587 . . . H1571 nor you , H859 . . . H1571 nor our children . H2945"
Genesis,43,9," I H595 will guarantee his safety . H6148 You may hold me H1245 personally responsible . H3027 If H518 I do not H3808 bring him back H935 - H413 and set him H3322 before you , H6440 then may I  bear the guilt before you H2398 all my life H3605 . . . . H3117"
Genesis,43,10," If we had not H3588 . . . H3884 delayed , H4102 . . . H3588 we could have come and gone H7725 . . . H2088 twice H6471 by now . ” H6258"
Genesis,43,11," Then their father H1 Israel H3478 said H559 to them , H413 “ If H518 it must be so , H3651 then H645 do H6213 this : H2063 Put H3947 some of the best products H2173 of the land H776 in your packs H3627 and carry them down H3381 as a gift H4503 for the man — H376 a little H4592 balm H6875 and a little H4592 honey , H1706 spices H5219 and myrrh , H3910 pistachios H992 and almonds . H8247"
Genesis,43,12, Take H3947 double H4932 the silver H3701 with you H3027 so that H853 you may return H7725 the silver H3701 that was put back H7725 . . . H3027 into the mouths H6310 of your sacks . H572 Perhaps H194 it H1931 was a mistake . H4870
Genesis,43,13," - H853 Take H3947 your brother as well , H251 and return H7725 to H413 the man H376 at once . H6965"
Genesis,43,14," May God H410 Almighty H7706 grant H5414 you  mercy H7356 before H6440 the man , H376 that he may release H7971 your  - H853 other H312 - H853 brother H251 along with Benjamin . H1144 As for me , H589 if H834 I am bereaved , H7921 I am bereaved . ” H7921"
Genesis,43,15," So the men H582 - H853 took H3947 these H2063 gifts , H4503 along with double H4932 the amount of silver H3701 . . . H3947 . . . , H3027 and H853 Benjamin as well . H1144 vvv H6965 Then they hurried down H3381 to Egypt H4714 and stood H5975 before H6440 Joseph . H3130"
Genesis,43,16," When Joseph H3130 saw H7200 Benjamin H1144 with [his brothers] , H854 - H853 he said H559 to the steward H834 of H5921 his house , H1004 “ Take H935 these men H582 to my house . H1004 Slaughter H2873 an animal H2874 and prepare it , H3559 for H3588 they shall dine H398 . . . H582 with me H854 at noon . ” H6672"
Genesis,43,17, The man H376 did H6213 as H834 Joseph H3130 had commanded H559 and took H935 [the brothers] H376 - H853 - H582 to Joseph’s H3130 house . H1004
Genesis,43,18," But the [brothers] H582 were frightened H3372 that H3588 they had been taken H935 to Joseph’s H3130 house . H1004 “ We H587 have been brought H935 here because of H5921 . . . H1697 the silver H3701 that was returned H7725 in our bags H572 the first time , ” H8462 they said . H559 “ They intend H1556 . . . H5921 to overpower H5307 us H5921 and take H3947 us H853 as slaves , H5650 along with H853 our donkeys . ” H2543"
Genesis,43,19, So they approached H5066 Joseph’s H3130 steward H376 - H834 - H5921 . . . H1004 and spoke H1696 to him H413 . . . H413 at the entrance H6607 to the house . H1004
Genesis,43,20," “ Please , H994 sir , ” H113 they said , H559 “ we really did come down H3381 . . . H3381 here the first time H8462 to buy H7666 food . H400"
Genesis,43,21," But H1961 when H3588 we came H935 to H413 the place we lodged for the night , H4411 we opened H6605 - H853 our sacks H572 and, behold , H2009 each of us [found] H376 his silver H3701 in the mouth H6310 of his sack ! H572 It was the full amount H4948 of our silver , H3701 and we have brought it back H7725 - H853 with us . H3027"
Genesis,43,22, We have brought H3381 additional H312 silver H3701 with us H3027 to buy H7666 food . H400 We do not H3808 know H3045 who H4310 put H7760 our silver H3701 in our sacks . ” H572
Genesis,43,23," “ It is fine H7965 . . . , ”  said the steward . H559 “ Do not H408 be afraid . H3372 Your God , H430 the God H430 of your father , H1 gave H5414 you  the treasure H4301 [that was] in your sacks . H572 I received H935 . . . H413 your silver . ” H3701 Then he brought Simeon H8095 out H3318 to them H413 - . H853"
Genesis,43,24," And the [steward] H376 - H853 took H935 the men H582 into Joseph’s H3130 house , H1004 gave them H5414 water H4325 to wash H7364 their feet , H7272 and provided H5414 food H4554 for their donkeys . H2543"
Genesis,43,25," Since H3588 [the brothers] had been told H8085 that H3588 they were going to eat H398 a meal H3899 there , H8033 they prepared H3559 - H853 their gift H4503 for H5704 Joseph’s H3130 arrival H935 at noon . H6672"
Genesis,43,26," When Joseph H3130 came H935 home , H1004 they presented H935 . . .  him H853 with the gifts H4503 - H834 they had brought H3027 . . . , H1004 and they bowed H7812 . . .  to the ground before him . H776"
Genesis,43,27," He asked H7592 . . .  if they were well , H7965 and then he asked , H559 “ vvv H7965 How is your elderly H2205 father H1 - H834 you told [me about] ? H559 Is he still H5750 alive ? ” H2416"
Genesis,43,28," “ Your servant H5650 our father H1 is well , ” H7965 they answered . H559 “ He is still H5750 alive . ” H2416 And they bowed down H6915 to honor him . H7812"
Genesis,43,29," When [Joseph] looked up H5375 . . . H5869 and saw H7200 - H853 his brother H251 Benjamin , H1144 his own mother’s H517 son , H1121 he asked , H559 “ Is this H2088 your youngest H6996 brother , H251 the one H834 you told me about ? ” H559 . . . H413 Then he declared , H559 “ May God H430 be gracious to you , H2603 my son . ” H1121"
Genesis,43,30," Joseph H3130 hurried H4116 out because H3588 he was moved H3648 . . . H7356 to tears H1245 . . . H1058 for H413 his brother , H251 and he went H935 to a private room H2315 to weep H1058 . . . . H8033"
Genesis,43,31," Then he washed H7364 his face H6440 and came back out . H3318 Regaining his composure , H662 he said , H559 “ Serve H7760 the meal . ” H3899"
Genesis,43,32," They separately served H7760 Joseph , H905 [his brothers] , H905 and the Egyptians . H4713 They ate H398 - H854 separately H905 because H3588 the Egyptians H4713 would H3201 not H3808 eat H398 . . . H3899 with H854 the Hebrews , H5680 since H3588 that H1931 was detestable H8441 to them . H4713"
Genesis,43,33," They were seated H3427 before [Joseph] H6440 in order by age , H1062 . . . H6812 from the firstborn H1060 to the youngest , H6810 and the men H582 looked at H413 one H376 another H7453 in astonishment . H8539"
Genesis,43,34," When the portions H4864 . . . H854 were served H5375 to them H413 from Joseph’s table , H6440 Benjamin’s H1144 . . . H4864 portion H4864 was five H2568 times H3027 larger than H7235 any of the others . H3605 So they feasted H8354 and drank freely H7937 with [Joseph] . H5973"
Genesis,44,1," Then Joseph instructed H6680 - H853 his steward H834 . . . H5921 . . . H1004 . . . : H559 “ Fill the men’s H582 sacks H572 with H4390 - H853 as much food H400 as H834 they can H3201 carry , H5375 and put H7760 each one’s H376 silver H3701 in the mouth H6310 of his sack . H572"
Genesis,44,2," - H853 Put H7760 my cup , H1375 the silver H3701 one , H1375 in the mouth H6310 of the youngest one’s H6996 - H853 sack , H572 along with the silver H3701 for his grain . ” H7668 So [the steward] did H6213 . . . H1697 as Joseph H3130 - H834 had instructed . H1696"
Genesis,44,3," At daybreak H1242 . . . , H215 the men H582 were sent on their way H7971 . . . H1992 with their donkeys . H2543"
Genesis,44,4," They H1992 had not H3808 gone H3318 - H853 far H7368 from the city H5892 when Joseph H3130 told H559 his steward H834 . . . H5921 . . . , H1004 “ Pursue H7291 . . . H310 the men H582 at once , H6965 and when you overtake them , H5381 ask H559 . . . , H413 ‘ Why H4100 have you repaid H7999 vvv H8478 good H2896 with evil ? H7451"
Genesis,44,5, Is this not [the cup] H3808 . . . H2088 - H834 my master H113 - H1931 drinks from H8354 and uses for divination H5172 . . . ? H5172 What H834 you have done H6213 is wicked ! ’” H7489
Genesis,44,6," When [the steward] overtook them , H5381 he relayed H1696 these H428 words H1697 to them . H413 - H853"
Genesis,44,7, “ Why H4100 does my lord H113 say H1696 these H428 things ? ” H1697 they asked H559 . . . . H413 “ Your servants H5650 could not possibly H2486 do H6213 such H2088 a thing . H1697
Genesis,44,8, vvv H2005 We even brought back H7725 to you H413 from the land H776 of Canaan H3667 the silver H3701 - H834 we found H4672 in the mouths H6310 of our sacks . H572 Why H349 would we steal H1589 silver H3701 or H176 gold H2091 from your master’s H113 house ? H1004
Genesis,44,9," If any H834 of your servants H5650 is found H4672 to have it , H854 he must die , H4191 and the rest H587 . . . H1571 will become H1961 slaves H5650 of my lord . ” H113"
Genesis,44,10," “ vvv H1571 vvv H6258 As you say , ” H1697 replied the steward . H559 . . . H3651 “ But only the one H1931 who H834 is found H4672 with [the cup] H854 will be H1961 my  slave , H5650 and the rest of you H859 shall be H1961 free of blame . ” H5355"
Genesis,44,11, So each H376 - H853 one quickly H4116 lowered H3381 his sack H572 to the ground H776 and opened H6605 . . . H376 it . H572
Genesis,44,12," The steward searched , H2664 beginning H2490 with the oldest H1419 and ending H3615 with the youngest — H6996 and the cup H1375 was found H4672 in Benjamin’s H1144 sack . H572"
Genesis,44,13," Then they all tore H7167 their clothes , H8071 - H376 - H5921 loaded H6006 their donkeys , H2543 and returned H7725 to the city . H5892"
Genesis,44,14," When Judah H3063 and his brothers H251 arrived at H935 Joseph’s H3130 house , H1004 he H1931 was still H5750 there , H8033 and they fell H5307 to the ground H776 before him . H6440"
Genesis,44,15, “ What H4100 is this H2088 deed H4639 - H834 you have done ? ” H6213 Joseph H3130 declared H559 .  “ Do you not H3808 know H3045 that H3588 a man H376 - H834 like me H3644 can surely divine the truth H5172 . . . ? ” H5172
Genesis,44,16, “ What H4100 can we say H559 to my lord ? ” H113 Judah H3063 replied . H559 “ How H4100 can we plead ? H1696 How H4100 can we justify ourselves ? H6663 God H430 has exposed H4672 - H853 the iniquity H5771 of your servants . H5650 We are now H2005 my lord’s H113 slaves — H5650 both H1571 we H587 and H1571 the one H834 who was found H4672 with H3027 the cup . ” H1375
Genesis,44,17," But Joseph replied , H559 “ Far be it H2486 from me  to do H6213 this . H2063 The man H376 who H834 was found H4672 with H3027 . . . H1931 the cup H1375 will be H1961 my  slave . H5650 The rest of you H859 may return H5927 to H413 your father H1 in peace . ” H7965"
Genesis,44,18," Then Judah H3063 approached H5066 [Joseph] H413 and said , H559 “ Sir H994 . . . , H113 please H4994 let your servant H5650 . . . H1697 . . . H241 speak H1696 personally to my lord . H113 Do not H408 be angry H2734 . . . H639 with your servant , H5650 for H3588 you are equal to H3644 Pharaoh himself . H6547"
Genesis,44,19," My lord H113 asked H7592 - H853 his servants , H5650 . . . H559 ‘ Do you have H3426 . . .  a father H1 or H176 a brother ? ’ H251"
Genesis,44,20," And we answered H559 . . . H413 . . . , H113 ‘ We have H3426 . . .  an elderly H2205 father H1 and a younger brother , H6996 the child H3206 of his old age . H2208 The boy’s brother H251 is dead . H4191 He H1931 is the only H905 one of his mother’s H517 sons left , H3498 and his father H1 loves him . ’ H157"
Genesis,44,21," Then you told H559 . . . H413 your servants , H5650 ‘ Bring him down H3381 to me H413 so that I can see H7760 him H5921 for myself . ’ H5869"
Genesis,44,22," So we said H559 to H413 my lord , H113 ‘ The boy H5288 cannot H3808 . . . H3201 leave H5800 - H853 his father . H1 If he were to leave , H5800 - H853 his father H1 would die . ’ H4191"
Genesis,44,23," But you said H559 to H413 your servants , H5650 ‘ vvv H518 Unless H3808 your younger H6996 brother H251 comes down H3381 with you , H854 you will not H3808 see H7200 my face H6440 again . ’ H3254"
Genesis,44,24," Now when H1961 . . . H3588 we returned H5927 to H413 your servant H5650 my father , H1 we relayed H5046 your words H1697 . . . H113 to  him . H853"
Genesis,44,25," Then our father H1 said , H559 ‘ Go back H7725 and buy H7666 us  some H4592 food . ’ H400"
Genesis,44,26," But we answered , H559 ‘ We cannot H3808 . . . H3201 go down there H3381 unless H518 . . . H3426 our younger H6996 brother H251 goes H3381 . . . H3588 with us . H854 So if our younger H6996 brother H251 is not H369 with us , H854 we cannot H3808 . . . H3201 see H7200 . . . H6440 the man . ’ H376"
Genesis,44,27," And your servant H5650 my father H1 said H559 to us , H413 ‘ You H859 know H3045 that H3588 my wife H802 bore H3205 me  two sons . H8147"
Genesis,44,28," When one of them H259 was gone H3318 . . . , H854 I said : H559 “ Surely H389 he has been torn to pieces H2963 . . . . ” H2963 And I have not H3808 seen him H7200 . . . H5704 since . H2008"
Genesis,44,29," - H853 Now if you also take H3947 - H1571 this one H2088 from H5973 me H6440 and harm H611 comes to him , H7136 you will bring my gray hair H7872 down H3381 - H853 to Sheol H7585 in sorrow . ’ H7451"
Genesis,44,30," So H6258 if the boy H5288 is not H369 with us H854 when I return H935 to H413 your servant , H5650 and [if] my father , H1 whose life H5315 is wrapped up H7194 in the boy’s life , H5315"
Genesis,44,31," - H1961 sees H7200 that H3588 the boy H5288 [is] not [with us] , H369 he will die . H4191 Then your servants H5650 - H853 will have brought the gray hair H7872 of your servant H5650 our father H1 down H3381 to Sheol H7585 in sorrow . H3015"
Genesis,44,32," Indeed , H3588 your servant H5650 guaranteed H6148 the boy’s safety H5288 - H853 to H5973 my father , H1 saying , H559 ‘ If H518 I do not H3808 return him H935 to you , H413 I will H3605 bear the guilt H2398 before you, my father , H1 all my life . ’ H3117"

Genesis,44,34, For H3588 how H349 can I go back H5927 to H413 my father H1 without H369 . . . H854 the boy ? H5288 I could not bear H6435 to see H7200 the misery H7451 that H834 would overwhelm H4672 - H853 [him] . ” H1
Genesis,45,1," Then Joseph H3130 could H3201 no longer H3808 control himself H662 before all H3605 his attendants , H5324 vvv H5921 and he cried out , H7121 “ Send everyone H3605 . . .

Genesis,45,2," But he wept H1065 so loudly H5414 - H853 - H6963 that the Egyptians H4713 heard him , H8085 and Pharaoh’s H6547 household H1004 [soon] heard of it . H8085"
Genesis,45,3," Joseph H3130 said H559 to H413 his brothers , H251 “ I H589 am Joseph ! H3130 Is my father H1 still H5750 alive ? ” H2416 But they H251 were unable H3808 . . . H3201 to answer H6030 him , H853 because H3588 they were terrified H926 in his presence . H6440"
Genesis,45,4," Then Joseph H3130 said H559 to H413 his brothers , H251 “ Please H4994 . . . H413 come near me . ” H5066 And they [did so] . H5066 “ I H589 am Joseph , H3130 your brother , ” H251 he said , H559 “ the one H834 you sold H4376 - H853 into Egypt ! H4714"
